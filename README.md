## üìå Project Overview
Employee attrition (voluntary resignations) is a critical problem for HR departments due to the costs associated with losing and replacing skilled workers. This project aims to:

Predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

Identify key features influencing employee attrition.

Evaluate model performance under different thresholds to optimize recall.

## üìÇ Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance (Fictional data).

Rows: 1470 employee records.

Features: 35+ attributes including demographic, job role, income, satisfaction metrics, etc.

Target: Attrition (Yes/No)

## üéØ Project Goals

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the impact of various features on Attrition

Preprocess and explore the dataset.

Train multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Tune hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV with KFold cross-validation.

Evaluate models using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

Experiment with classification thresholds to improve recall (i.e., better detect likely leavers).

Analyze feature importance


## üìä Methodology
Data Preprocessing:

Handled categorical encoding (OneHotEncoding).

Scaled numeric features using StandardScaler.

Model Training:

Split into training and testing sets

Trained models using RandomizedSearchCV + KFold cross-validation.

Tuned hyperparameters for each model.

Evaluation:

Metrics used: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Tested multiple thresholds (e.g., 0.3, 0.4) to prioritize recall over accuracy.

Feature Importance:

Extracted Logistic Regression coefficients.

Identified top contributing features to attrition prediction.


üîç Key Findings
Top features impacting attrition (from Logistic Regression coefficients):

OverTime

MaritalStatus_Single

JobInvolvement

StockOptionLevel

JobSatisfaction

EnvironmentSatisfaction

TotalWorkingYears

DistanceFromHome

MonthlyIncome

These insights can help HR teams prioritize retention strategies focused on high-risk profiles.

üßæ Conclusion
This project successfully built a machine learning pipeline to:

Predict employee attrition using classification models.

Tune models with cross-validation.

Improve recall by adjusting classification thresholds.

Interpret model coefficients to understand key attrition drivers.

These results provide valuable, actionable insights for HR departments aiming to improve employee retention.
